> The model said it was learning. The validator agreed. We built the system that watches both.
> When we ran it on ourselves, it caught a **+7 pp claim that didn't reproduce**. That is the result.

ARGUS is the first **OpenEnv-compliant** self-improvement environment that *refuses* training steps where the model is lying to itself about whether it learned. Built for the **Meta · OpenEnv Self-Improvement Competition (2026)**.

## The result, in one paragraph

Every self-improving AI in 2026 reports gains. Almost none can prove the gains are real. ARGUS adds a *second observer* at every level of a self-play loop — solver chains, training episodes, full runs — and refuses any training step where two independent observers disagree. We ran it three times with different seeds. Seed 0 lifted external GSM8K pass@1 by +7 pp; seed 1 *regressed* by −5 pp; the metacognition-ablated control landed at +2.5 pp. **The 3-seed mean is +1.5 pp, well inside the Wilson 95% noise band.** Our own +7 pp headline didn't reproduce — and ARGUS is the system that caught it.

What *did* reproduce: the architecture's defensive density (19 / 16 events with metacognition vs 4 events without — **4× thinner ablation**), and the live discovery of three previously-unnamed failure modes (Types F, G, H) the architecture surfaced *during* training.

## Headline numbers

| | seed 0 (full v3.4) | seed 1 (full v3.4) | ablation (no-metacog) |
|---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| External pass@1 Δ | **+7.0 pp** | **−5.0 pp** | **+2.5 pp** |
| Defensive events (15 ep) | 19 | 16 | **4** |
| Lie firings (global) | 2 | 4 | 3 |
| Per-cluster detections | 8 | 6 | **0** |
| ERCV soft-rollbacks | 2 | 1 | 1 |
| Causal attributions | 7 | 5 | **0** |
| Live-discovered failure mode | **Type G** (plateau capture) | **Type H** (curriculum collapse) | — |

3-seed mean: **+1.5 pp** · Wilson 95% noise band: **±13.9 pp**.

## What's novel

1. **Chain-consensus reward** — replaces majority voting with a two-axis score (outcome agreement × intermediate-step agreement). Catches the case where every chain hallucinates the same fake premise and all "agree."
2. **Three-loop layered observers** — inner (per-step solver chains), middle (per-episode capability map + dual gauges), outer (per-run ERCV refusal gate at z < −2.5).
3. **Live failure-mode discovery** — the architecture asked *"which cluster is regressing?"* during training, and surfaced **3 previously-unnamed failure modes** (F, G, H) across 3 consecutive runs.
4. **Self-narrating ledger** — every defense event is logged as a structured JSONL entry with a causal hypothesis. The system writes its own forensic record.

## The 8 named failure modes

| | type | mechanism | origin |
|---|---|---|---|
| A | drift | proposer collapses to one type | designed (v1) |
| B | novelty collapse | all chains agree too early | designed (v1) |
| C | compute starvation | memorising the replay buffer | designed (v1) |
| D | catastrophic forgetting | "epi up, retest down" | designed (v3.1) |
| E | saturation | frontier zone empties | designed (v3.2) |
| **F** | **proposer hallucination** | proposer invents fake numeric premises; all 14 chains agree | **discovered live · v3.3 · 2026-04-24** |
| **G** | **plateau capture** | a single cluster captures the curriculum and saturates | **discovered live · v3.4 seed 0 · 2026-04-25** |
| **H** | **defense-induced curriculum collapse** | a defense fires, easy/hard ratio explodes 1.10 → 6.17 | **discovered live · v3.4 seed 1 · 2026-04-26** |

**Better defenses don't eliminate failure modes — they surface deeper ones.** The taxonomy is open-ended by design.

## Architecture (in five lines)

```python
# the load-bearing trick of the outer loop
def ercv_refuse(epi_gain, retest_trend, history):
    z = (epi_gain - mean(history)) / std(history)
    if z < -2.5 and retest_trend < 0:
        return "REFUSE"           # soft rollback to last good adapter
    return "COMMIT"
```

Three nested observers, each at a different timescale:

| loop | timescale | watches | refuses when |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Inner** | per-step | solver chains | chains agree on outcome but diverge on intermediate numbers |
| **Middle** | per-episode | capability map · dual gauges (epiplexity + retest) | per-cluster signal disagrees with global signal |
| **Outer** | per-run | full-run statistics | z(epi_gain) < −2.5 against historical retest baseline |

## OpenEnv contract

```
GET  /healthz                       — liveness
POST /reset                         — start a new session
POST /step   { session_id, action } — one env transition
GET  /state?session_id=...          — inspect env info
GET  /buffer?session_id=...         — training buffer for agent SFT
POST /clear_buffer                  — agent signals it consumed the buffer
```

The agent drives propose→solve→score→train. The env returns `{ obs, reward, terminated, info }` per step, where `info` carries lie-type scores, ERCV decision, capability-map snapshot, and causal-attribution hits. Reward is `chain_consensus_combined` (outcome × process). Training pairs come pre-weighted in `/buffer`; the agent skips the SFT step when ERCV refused.

## Reproduce

```bash
# Local install
git clone https://github.com/VP-Vaibhav-Pandey/argus-env
cd argus-env
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate    # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r hf_space/requirements-env.txt

# Run the env locally
cd hf_space
uvicorn src.env.openenv_app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 7860

# Or via Docker
docker build -t argus-env hf_space/
docker run -p 7860:7860 argus-env
```

The full self-improvement training pipeline (model + env + agent) is reproducible from `notebooks/argus_colab.ipynb`. End-to-end runtime ≈ 8 min on a free Colab T4 (or ~5 h for the full 15-episode v3.4 stack on RTX 5070 Ti).

## Honest framing

We will not lead with a metric we can't reproduce. The +7 pp on seed 0 is real but single-seed; mean across three seeds is +1.5 pp within Wilson noise. **The architecture's contribution is not a metric trick — it is a measurement instrument.** What reproduces is defensive density (19 / 16 events with metacognition · 4 without), and the live discovery of new named failure modes that previous taxonomies didn't have.
